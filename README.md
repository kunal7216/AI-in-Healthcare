# Artifical-Intelligence-in-Healthcare
A collection of projects using Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare.

This collection is part of a specialization on Coursera. Each course focuses on AI applied to medical diagnosis, and medical treatment. From analyzing 2D x-ray images to using Natural Language Processing for extracting information from medical reports, this kind of software will play an integral role in healthcare for decades to come.
